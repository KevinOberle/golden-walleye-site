# Boats and Equipment

- Boats must be equipped with at least two correctly sized and CSA-approved life jackets. Life jackets must be worn whenever the speed of the boat exceeds 10 km per hour
- All boats must have at least one working cell phone on board, matching the number provided on the registration form. If a different cell phone is to be used it must be registered.
- All boats must have a well of no less than 45 quarts (11.25 gallons or 51 litres). The live well can be portable or built-in, but in either case it must have both a water exchange pump and an aeration pump
- It is recommended that fish be transported in an aft-located live well, as this minimizes stress and harm to the fish
- Registration packages are provided to all teams, including map and copy of rules. Packages must be kept on board

# Weather Conditions and Safety

- The Tournament will only proceed during favourable weather conditions. The “Weather Network” weather service, as evaluated at the “Grouard” weather station, will serve as the sole and official weather assessment and forecast
- In the event that either of the “morning” or “afternoon” forecasts for the current fishing day predict sustained winds of 30km per hour or greater, the tournament will be cancelled for that day
- In the event that either of the “morning” or “afternoon” forecasts for the current fishing day predict sustained winds of less than 30km per hour, but weather conditions are marginal and potentially unfavourable, the tournament committee will convene a meeting one hour prior to the commencement of the day’s fishing to discuss the situation. The committee meeting will include 10 randomly selected boat captains to provide advice. The committee will consider the advice, and will subsequently decide on whether or not to cancel the tournament for that day. A decision by the committee to cancel the tournament for that day will be final, and not subject to appeal
- The tournament committee may also decide at any point during the day to cancel the days fishing, regardless of the forecast, if in their opinion the conditions are dangerous or otherwise unsuitable.
- In the event that the tournament is cancelled on any particular day, the Monday of the long weekend (Labour Day) will serve as an alternate fishing day.
- In the event that any 2 of the tournament days are cancelled, the tournament will be declared to be a one-day tournament, and prizes will be adjusted and awarded appropriately
- In the event that all 3 of the tournament days are cancelled, the tournament itself will be cancelled and no prizes will be awarded. All teams will receive a full refund of their tournament entry fee

# Conducting the Tournament

- All teams will conduct themselves in a courteous, sportsmanlike, safe, and ethical manner, at all times. Failure to do so can result in disqualification at the sole discretion of the tournament officials, and could similarly result in disqualification from any and all future tournaments
- All boats must be inspected prior to launch time each day, and at any other time during the tournament if so directed by a tournament official. Inspection will determine whether or not the boat is carrying necessary equipment, and whether or not the boat is carrying prohibited equipment
- All teams will be inspected at the second marina at Shaw’s Point Lakeside resort – teams launching at other points on the lake must attend the marina for inspection prior to fishing for the day
- All teams must check in at the end of each day. Tags are provided in the registration package - they are to be handed in at the weigh station at the end of fishing each day
- All Alberta sport fishing regulations are in effect and must be followed
- All Provincial and Federal acts and regulations are in effect and must be followed, unless more restrictive or stringent rules are specified by the tournament committee
- All fish must be caught with a rod and reel, in a legal, normal, and usual manner, using only a legal hook (as defined in the Alberta sport fishing regulations). All hooks must be barbless
- The use of bait (as defined in the Alberta sport fishing regulations) and the use of artificial lures is permissible
- Fishing within one mile of the weigh station at the second marina is prohibited at all times
- Fishing in water deeper than 18 feet is prohibited
- All fishing will occur in an area of the lake west of a line from Big Point to Driftpile point, and east of the entrance to the Grouard Channel (consult the map in your registration package). GPS coordinates are:
  - Big Point N 55” 28.703, W 115” 34.228
  - Driftpile Point N 55” 23.000, W 115” 37.910
- Start and finish times will be strictly enforced - leaving early or arriving late will result in disqualification for the day. (Start and end times will be assigned at the mandatory rules meeting on the Friday evening prior to the start of the tournament)
- Teams must depart the weigh station and rally to the west of the outer marker boat until signalled to proceed to their fishing area at the official start of the day
- Teams will return to the outer marker boat to be counted as returned prior to proceeding to the weigh station at the end of each day. While waiting for access to the weigh station, all boats must remain on the lake side of marker buoys
- Boats may not contact the shore or other boats during the tournament hours. If a team encounters another boat in distress they may make contact with that boat in order to assist – they will not be penalized for such contact even if the assistance results in them arriving at the weigh station past their required day-end time. A team offering assistance must notify tournament officials immediately of their intent to do so. The boat in distress will be disqualified for the day if they do not return at the assigned time
- A team must have no more than two fish in possession at any one time for any reason. Violating possession rules will result in disqualification for the day
- No team may appear at the weigh station with a cumulative total of more than 4 fish in one day of the tournament. As above, violating possession rules will result in disqualification for the day

# Determining Eligible Fish

- The Golden Walleye Classic is a live-release tournament – all fish must be live, all fish will be released after weigh-in
- All weights and clips must be removed from fish and removed from the live well prior to inspection at the weigh station. Fish found with weights attached will be disqualified
- Fish brought to the weigh station must at least 50 cm in length (with tail pinched). Fish under 50 cm will count as part of the daily catch limit, but their weight will not be measured, and no weight will be added to that day’s total. In addition, a penalty of - 2.0 lbs. will be applied to the days’ total for each fish under 50 cm that is brought to the weigh station
- Only live fish will be weighed. Tournament officials will declare fish to be live or possibly dead in the live well before removal – possibly dead fish will be placed in a swim tank for further assessment. Once in the swim tank, the fish can be touched, moved, and manipulated by the angler for a period of 60 seconds, but then must be allowed to swim untouched for a further 60 seconds. During the second 60 second period the fish must remain upright, must display regular gill movement, and must be able to sound to the bottom of the tank. If the fish is unable to do this, or if it ends the 60 second assessment period on its side or inverted, the fish will be declared dead. A dead fish will not be weighed, but will be counted as a caught fish to be included in the daily catch limit and it cannot be replaced. No additional penalty will be applied
- Fizzing of fish (removal of air through puncture) is not permitted. Fish displaying fizzing marks, regardless of the origin of those marks, will be disqualified upon inspection at the weigh-station, and their weight will not be included in the total weight for the day. No additional weight penalty will be applied. The fish will, however, be counted as caught fish to be included in the daily catch limit, and it cannot be replaced.
- While on the lake, if a caught fish displays possible fizzing marks and the team is unsure, they may take a photograph of the marks and text it to 780-523-7385 for a pre-ruling without penalty

# Weigh-In

- All live well lids must be closed when teams dock at the weigh station
- A maximum of 4 Walleye per team per day will be eligible for weigh-in, and they must be weighed in at least 2 visits (with a maximum of 2 fish) to the weigh station. Teams may visit the weigh station with only 1 fish, resulting in a possible maximum of 4 visits in a day
- Each team will receive a copy of the printed receipt for weigh-in, and they will be required to initial the copy that is retained in the weigh station
- Teams may request a second weigh-in if they are dissatisfied with the results of the first, but if they do so the second weigh-in will be the final weigh-in, regardless if it is larger or smaller than the first
- No substitution or replacement fish will be allowed after weigh in.
- All prizes are determined by weight, not length. Apparent ties will be resolved by the weigh-in time - the earliest time a weight was recorded determines the winner of a tie (weigh-in times are recorded on the printed receipts)

# Mandatory Inspections

- All boats must be inspected prior to launch time each day, and at any other time during the tournament as directed by a tournament official. Teams launching at other points on the lake must attend the marina for inspection prior to fishing for the day
- Tournament officials will be on the lake during fishing hours and may randomly board and inspect boats
- Failing an inspection, or failing to allow an inspection (at any time), will result in disqualification from the tournament

# End of Tournament

- An Award ceremony will be held in evening of final day of the tournament. All teams are encouraged to attend

# Protests

- Any team disqualified from the tournament for any reason will forfeit all entry fees and will receive no refund. No protests will be considered
- Teams may protest the results of a weigh in, matters pertaining to the conduct or the tournament, or the ruling of a tournament official. Such protests must be made in writing, they must be accompanied by a $100 fee, and they must be made within 30 minutes of the completion of daily weigh-in. A tournament rules committee will convene to consider the validity of a protest - their decision will be final, and will not be subject to further protest. If the protest is found to be valid, the protest fee will be refunded
